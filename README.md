# kingdombattles

From the Kingdom Battles news feed:

> Hello, and welcome to an artifact of my learning process.
> 
> Kingdom Battles began development in May of 2019, when I was extremely inexperienced with developing PBBGs, and web technology in general. From memory, it seemed to run well for about a month, before I and the players got bored and moved on - on the whole though, I do consider this game to be a success.
> 
> In many ways, I learned a lot from this project, and have fond memories of it. As such, I've updated it's underlying tech to keep it running safely and securely for a little while longer, but I won't be expanding it any further.
> 
> For the future, I'm developing a successor game called [Egg Trainer](https://eggtrainer.com), which is the product of the lessons learned here. Check it out, and feel free to say hello to that community! See you there!
