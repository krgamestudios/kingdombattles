Instructions

<div class="break" />

This is a resource accumulation game, with some similarities to idle games. The idea is that you recruit new units once per day, train them as soldiers, and send them to attack other players. You can also train spies and scientists, which each grant their own benefits.

The goal of the game is to be at the top of the game ladder for as long as possible.

### Attacking

<div class="break" />

The best way to gain gold in this game is to attack other players. You can do this via the [game ladder](/ladder). Click on someone's profile, and click the "attack" button as soon as you have a soldier. You'll earn gold from attacking, even if you lose the battle, so <span style="color:red">attacking high-ranked players is encouraged!</span>

### Recruits

<div class="break" />

Untrained recruits gain you 1 gold piece evey so often - the only unit type that grants a passive income. They also act as a defense force when your soldiers are away, but they have lower combat skills. When recriuts are attacked, it is marked as "undefended" in the combat log. Recruits can still use equipment.

### Soldiers

<div class="break" />

Soldiers are your bread and butter unit in this game. They are experts at combat, and as such are much stronger than recruits. They are used to raid other player's kingdoms for gold, but larger attack forces tend to suffer casualties due to battle. Combat takes time - 1 minute for every soldier that you have. During combat, soldiers will not be available to defend your kingdom. They also use any equipment that you've purchased.

### Scientists

<div class="break" />

Scientists don't fight. Instead, they offer other means of gaining advantage over other players, such as granting access to equipment. Equipment such as weapons boost and attacking force's strength, while armour boosts the defending force. Consumables are also usable by both attackers and defenders.

### Spies

<div class="break" />

Spies are another way to gain an advantage over your enemies. They're more expensive than soldiers, and they might not always produce results. However, they can be used at the same time as soldiers, and they can also steal your target's equipment. Spies have a 50% chance of stealing gold, and each spy has a 50% chance of stealing an item. Since their job is harder, they take 10 minutes for each spy used.

Be careful though - if the spies are found, they will <span style="color:red">all be killed</span>.

### Equipment

<div class="break" />

New equipment becomes accessible as soon as you train a new scientist, and purchased equipment remains in your inventory if the scientist is untrained. Each soldier uses one weapon during attacks, or one piece of armour when attacked. They also use consumables when attacking or attacked, which are then lost. Recruits also use armour and consumables when attacked.

### Badges

<div class="break" />

Badges are bling - vanity items that appear next to your name on the game ladder and profile. Some are easy to unlock, others require specific situations. Others still are exclusives, and no longer available. You can see a full list of badges on the [badges list page](/badges/list).
