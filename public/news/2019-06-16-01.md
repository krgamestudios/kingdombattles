Tonight's All Nighter

_16 June 2019_

Things I've completed so far:

* King Of The Hill badge is now enabled (requires 24 hours at the top of the ladder).
* Capture the flag is implemented; user [Ratstail91](/profile?username=Ratstail91) will have it to begin with (that's me!).

Both of these badges are considered experimental, just for the record. I think I managed it, but don't be surprised if I have to roll the database back two days...

P.S. My code is so messy. So, so messy...
