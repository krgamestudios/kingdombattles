Moderation Of Usernames
---
_5 June 2019_

Let's talk about something serious: user \[removed for their privacy\]. More importantly, their cheeky (pun intended) username.

Now, I don't mind this name in particular, although some websites might outright ban him, and other users with similarly creative names.

However, I will take exception to any usernames that are outright hurtful, attack any group or individual, or deliberately cross a line from funny or eye-rolling to offensive. This website is my house, and you are guests here; please remember that.

One of the items on my wishlist is a request from a fan - in game chat. This requires considerably more moderation than just usernames, so if the community can't be civil with just usernames, then I don't see any way that such a feature could be implemented in future.

If you feel something breeches these rules, I can most easily be reached via my discord server here: [KR Game Studios](https://discord.gg/FQmz8TN). My username is Ratstail91.

Thanks to \[removed for their privacy\] for bringing this topic to my attention, even if inadvertantly.
