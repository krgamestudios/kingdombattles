Updates and Refactoring!
---
_24 May 2019_

So today (and yesterday), I've been working on some backend stuff, refactoring the code to make it smoother. In particular, you'll notice a link to the game ladder in the side panel. This isn't active yet, and just leads to a missing page, but it's the very next thing I plan to implement - so you'll be able to see everyone in the game!

I've also implemented a logging system, so that if any errors occur, I'll be able to find them, theoretically. It's already helped me identify a few issues, but the real test will be when a lot of people are playing at the same time.

Finally, I've also fixed the email bug - before, it could take over a minute for the verification email to arrive. Now it should arrive instantly. Interestingly, that wasn't a problem with my code, but rather how the server was configured. I'll have to keep that in mind if I ever migrate this project.

OK, I'll keep working, since it's still early in the day.
