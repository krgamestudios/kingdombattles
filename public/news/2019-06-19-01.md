It's Freezing In Here!

_19 June 2019_

Edit: Actually, I realize freezing the tick rate for EVERYONE is unfair if you're under 100 gold - you'll never be able to train a unit. As such, I've amended the algorithm to only affect those with gold equal to or higher than 100.

I've frozen the gold tick due to the recent surge in the gold supply. This is a temporary measure, as I'm hoping it'll drop to a more reasonable level as players do their thing.

I'm hoping to pull another all nighter tonight, simply because I do my best work at night. I'm also planning on releasing "content updates" every Sunday my time to keep everyone entertained. I'll try to add _something_ new gameplay-wise every week.

I've also noticed that the active player count has dropped to a worryingly low level, but this is because I haven't been advertising this game. I plan to post this across reddit again, so... new players inbound, hopefully.

I need to pull myself out of this comfy bed.
