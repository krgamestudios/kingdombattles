I neglect my sleeping pattern...

I'm testing code minimization and code splitting to deal with the slow load times reported by multiple people. The main cause is that this website is hosted in Australia, but I'm trying to minimize the impact with various techniques before progressing.

I didn't want to spend the night on something incredibly demanding like the attack button, so instead I spent the night on something incredibly demanding like optimisation. -_-
